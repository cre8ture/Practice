<BrandCaption>Black black doesn’t really exist (SEE: Vantablack, Black 3.0). 
Moreover, hard blacks can ‘hurt’ on screen, however, for now bodyLITERATE uses a hard black. We will likely change this 
in a future iterations. As described by Revaratio: "grey blacks look faded in print. Black is actually a pretty hard colour. 
EIL has a different black for print and digital. Pure black is never used.  
The print black is not a rich black, but should always be used with overprint on."

**Campuses** Each of the campuses is associated with a primary colour — this is used in campus specific communication or branding. For example, social media profiles, video borders, city platforms or campus signage. Countries use the colour of the campus capital.

### Contrast

Especially when using text, be mindful of contrast. Web standards recommend, for AA (minimum) and AAA (high) the following contrasts: (use this tool to check)

|       &nbsp;       |      &nbsp;               | AA           | AAA           |
| :----------------- | ------------------------- |:------------:| :------------:| 
| Normal Text        | 16px + Regular            | 4.5:1        | 7:1           |
| Medium Text         | 32px + Bold, or 24px + | 3:1          | 4.5:1         |
| Large Text         | 42px + Bold, or 50px + | 3:1          | 4.5:1         |
