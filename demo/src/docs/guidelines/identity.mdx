## The Name

To maintain consistency across countries and languages, the name of bodyLITERATE is always written the same way: Title Case, with lowercase ```body``` and followed by uppercase ```LITERATE```.
To highlight the the name, we will often keep lowercase ```executive functions```, ```embody``` and ```create``` as the three lenses from which bodyLITERATE operates.
>FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS: the name bodyLITERATE is being analyzed for future considerations. We have wondered whether the word "LITERATE" creates an ablelist framework. Being "literate" 
has often been used as a way to be exclusionary, whether it's language-based literacy, math literacy, computer literacy. We want to celebrate the unique ways people find literacy and broaden this idea (example, phsyical literacy, artistic literacy). 
So our name is currently in flux and may change.

>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION TO MATERIAL DESIGN: The aim here is to use the framework of Material Design. 
Shapes are generally rectangles, but one can customize their corners. We aim to use clear, distinguishable shapes 
that give meaning based on size, position on the canvas and color.
